# Gemini Agent Project Notes: SkyUp

This document provides context for the SkyUp project, a self-hosted application stack, for the Gemini agent.

## Project Overview

SkyUp is a self-hosted application stack for running AI applications and workflow tools. It uses Podman and podman-compose for containerization. The stack is designed to be simple, accessible only from the host, and easily extendable for security hardening.

### Included Services

- **PostgreSQL (pgvector):** Vector-enabled database.
- **Open WebUI:** A user-friendly web interface for LLMs.
- **n8n:** Workflow automation.
- **SimStudio AI:** AI agent workflows.
- **Nginx:** Reverse proxy with HTTPS.

## Repository Structure

The key files in this repository are:

- `podman-compose.yml`: Defines the services for the application stack.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables, including secrets and credentials (generated by `init-env.sh`).
- `init-env.sh`: A script to generate the initial environment variables and create required directories.
- `initdb/`: Contains PostgreSQL initialization scripts.
- `nginx.conf`: The configuration file for the Nginx reverse proxy.

## Special requirements.

- put all service data this format:  .podman/contianer_name/directories... 
- put all password etc in `.env` (genreated by `init-env.sh` )

## Setup and Operation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Requires `podman`, `podman-compose`, `nginx`, and `certbot`.
2.  **Initialization:**
    - Run `./init-env.sh` to generate the `.env` file with necessary secrets and create the required data directories.
3.  **Start Services:** Use `podman-compose up -d` to start the application stack.
4.  **Database:** PostgreSQL is configured to be accessible only from the host (`127.0.0.1`). Initialization scripts in `initdb/` are run on the first startup to create databases and enable extensions.
5.  **Admin Creation:** The first user to register in Open WebUI will become an admin.

This information should provide the Gemini agent with a solid understanding of the SkyUp project, its components, and how to interact with it.
